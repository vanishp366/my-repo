# Project Title
"Data Cleansing and Type Conversion with Pandas: A Practical Guide"
## Getting Started
In the "Data Cleansing and Type Conversion with Pandas: A Practical Guide" project, we delve into the essential process of cleaning and preparing data for analysis using the powerful Python library, Pandas. The project focuses on a hands-on approach to data cleaning techniques, emphasizing the correction of data types to ensure accurate and efficient analysis.
### Prerequisites
Basic knowledge of Python programming and familiarity with Pandas library.
What things you need to install the software and how to install them

### Installing
Key Steps in the Project:

Exploratory data analysis of a dataset.
Checking the number of records and elements in the dataset.
Identifying column names and their data types.
Verifying a specific column's data type.
Correcting data types using .astype() method.
Validating data type changes with .dtypes.
Providing a step-by-step guide for users to follow.
Installing:
Downloading csv file
Loading the csv file 
Finding the necessary elements, columns, etc.
Running the Tests
	Breakdown of Tests
	The code in this project involves cleaning and formatting a dataset using Pandas. It includes methods to read CSV files, check data 	types, and convert columns to the correct data format. Here's an example breakdown of the tests:
Deployment:
To have Python and Pandas installed on my system. Clone the repository and execute the Python script to see the data cleaning and formatting in action.
